# Chip Thief

A goose robs a casino floor and runs for the fire exit, framed as CCTV surveillance
footage. One button, one ~10 second scripted run, no decisions mid-run — an entry for
[Chain Jam Vol. 1](https://jam.chain.wtf).

## Layout

```
prototypes/chip-thief.html        the game — single HTML file, no build step
prototypes/game.manifest.json     Chain casino SDK manifest
prototypes/vendor/                vendored penpal, keccak256 and self-hosted Archivo, Bodoni Moda, JetBrains Mono (SIL OFL) —
                                  no third-party request can delay first paint
prototypes/assets/                store images (icon, cover, social share) and favicon
contract/ChipThiefGame.sol        on-chain game contract (ICasinoGameV2)
contract/ICasinoGameV2.sol        vendored copy of the SDK's canonical interface
```

`chip-thief.html` runs two ways from the same code path:

- **Standalone** — open the file directly (or its hosted URL) in a browser. No host, no
  wallet: it runs a local `Math.random()`-seeded demo with the identical paytable.
- **Embedded** — loaded in an iframe by the chain.wtf host (or the SDK's local
  simulator), it opens a real on-chain session. The animation replays the exact draw
  sequence the contract made from the session's VRF word, reconstructed client-side —
  never a locally-rolled guess. What you see is what was actually paid.

All art is drawn procedurally to canvas, all sound is synthesised at runtime with the Web
Audio API — no asset files to load.

## The maths

Declared RTP **96.0%** (about 95.9% once the on-chain 100× cap is applied), bust rate
**22.3%**. There is exactly one way to lose a run — get caught while grabbing chips (each
chip you reach for is another roll, so greed is what catches you); no flat "tax" at the
door. Escaping isn't the same as winning, and the game says so: an escape that pays under
1× is shown as a loss. The median escape returns 0.84× and roughly 4 in 10 escapes pay
back the stake or more, with a real top end: **about 1 run in 90 reaches 5×, 1 in 190
reaches 10×, and 1 in 930 reaches 20×** (the jackpot chip is worth ~18× on its own).
Closed-form, and verified two ways:

- A Monte Carlo self-check in the page itself (Info → Maths and fairness; 200k rounds on load: simulated RTP
  next to the declared one, plus median escape).
- The on-chain contract, independently: 100,000 live `onRandomness` calls against the
  deployed contract matched the page's own outcome code bit-for-bit (0 mismatches) and
  returned 95.8% RTP / 22.4% bust — consistent with the declared figures within
  statistical noise for a heavy-tailed payout distribution.

**The outcome is drawn before the animation.** Every roll (which chips land, their value,
multipliers, staff contact, whether the run gets caught) is decided first — on-chain, from
a single VRF word, expanded via `keccak256(randomness, idx)` per draw — and the flight
path is generated afterward to pass through whatever was actually won. This is the only
way it works against a real VRF, and it's how real slot reels work.

On-chain payout is hard-capped at **100× wager**. In a 40M-round simulation of the exact
paytable, only about 1 run in 52,000 (two jackpot chips plus a multiplier) exceeds it,
which trims RTP by roughly 0.05%. It gives the vault's risk model an honest ceiling (a 99×
reserve per bet) instead of reserving against a tail nobody will ever hit.

## Running it

Open `prototypes/chip-thief.html` directly in a browser for the standalone demo. Sound
needs a user gesture first (browser autoplay policy), so audio starts on your first click.

To test the on-chain path, use the Chain casino SDK's local simulator
(`sdk.chain.wtf/casino` → `LOCAL_SIMULATOR.md`): serve `prototypes/` with a CORS-enabled
static server, drop `contract/ChipThiefGame.sol` into the simulator's watched
`simulator/contracts/` folder, then open the simulator with both the game URL and the
deployed contract address:

```
http://localhost:3300/?game=http://localhost:<port>/chip-thief.html&gameAddress=<deployed ChipThiefGame address>
```
